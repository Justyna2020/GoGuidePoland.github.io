          <p>A unique place that helps visitors understand contemporary Warsaw.
            This interactive museum commemorates the largest underground combat
            operation in German-occupied Europe during World War II. The 1944 Warsaw
            Uprising changed forever the face of the Polish capital.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The multimedia exhibition reflects the atmosphere of the Uprising,
              shows not only the military history of the 63 days of fighting and the
              everyday life of the civilian population, but also describes the post-war
              communist terror. Strolling along the granite pavement among the rubble of
              the destroyed capital, you will listen to the stories of the insurgents and
              see original exhibits from the uprising. You will understand how
              soldiers moving through the sewers felt and you will see a birds-eye
              view of the flattened city in the film City of Ruins.
              You can also take a selfie with a faithful replica of a Liberator B-24J.
              Drops with equipment for those fighting in Warsaw were made from such planes.
  At the heart of the museum is a steel monument that passes through all the floors of
  the building. Its walls are covered with the dates of each day of the uprising as well
   as bullet marks, and the sound of a beating heart that symbolises the life of Warsaw
   in 1944 comes from inside.
  In Freedom Park next to the museum, pay attention to the Memorial Wall. Nearly 11,000
   names of soldiers killed in the Uprising are engraved on it. Be sure to also pay
    attention to insurgent murals by well-known Polish artists on the “Wall of Art”.</p>
