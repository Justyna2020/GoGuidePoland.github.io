      <p>Warsaw’s Old Town is the finest and most picturesque part of the city.
       It was built during the 12th to 13th century and is surrounded by 14th
        century fortification walls. It played a major role in Poland’s history
        and cultural life since the beginning of its existence, and continues to
         do so even today. Visit Old Town to see the most beautiful houses and palaces
         in the city, dine at the market square, or check out the most inspiring
          museums Warsaw has to offer.</p>
          <p>Walk Around The Old Town Market Square. The Old Town Market Square
            dates back to the 13th century where it used to be the centre of
            Warsaw’s public life, hosting political speeches and executions.
             The buildings around it were wooden at the time, but what we can
              see nowadays dates back the 15th century. Today the market square
               offers a wide range of good restaurants and cocktail bars as
               well as street art and souvenirs. Once on the market square,
                you can also visit the Literature Museum and the Historical
                 Museum of Warsaw.</p>
